            <p>As previously mention Amway creates IBOs to sells products instead of doing marketing.
                When a person registered as an IBO in Amway, he/she can buy products directly from
                Amway online store in cheap price than its retail price. One IBO of Amway can sponsor
                other to join Amway and its continued. Amway gives some bonuses and incentives to their
                IBOs as per their PV and BV. 1 in 125 IBOs are millionaires because of Amway.
                Independent Business Owners (IBOs) are just that: independent. They are not "in Amway"
                but powered by Amway with a robust IBO Compensation Plan. An IBO and Amway are
                parties to a contract, which contains rules and responsibilities that govern the relationship.
                The main aim to increase the number of IBOs is create a brilliant impression about
                company in the hearts of people. To introduce the products and its quality. One of the main
                intentions to increase the IBOs is to create a fixed-customers for the company. </p>

            <li>Increase the quantity of retails</li>

            <p>Amway has good retail of its product. The maximum sale of Amway products is due to its
                IBOs members. An IBO of Amway can purchase every product but it quite difficult for the

                figures. China, Amway’s largest market, saw significant declines in the overall direct
                selling industry, yet Amway was able to improve market share and move up a spot to
                become the country’s number two direct selling company. Because of covid-19 as well
                the supplement of Amway was on high demand in china. Since its products are not
